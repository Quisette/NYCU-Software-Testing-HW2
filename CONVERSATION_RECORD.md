# Conversation Record: Tests & CI/CD Setup for Calc.js

## Date
October 22, 2025

## Objective
Write comprehensive tests for `calc.js` and set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline

## Project Context
- **Project Location**: `/Users/quisette/courses/software_testing/hw2_new`
- **Git Repository**: Yes (master branch)
- **Initial Files**:
  - `Calc.js` - Calculator class with `add()` method
  - `CalcTDD.pdf` - Project specification document

## Work Completed

### 1. Created package.json
**File**: [package.json](package.json)

Configuration for the Node.js project with:
- Project metadata (name: "calc-project", version: "1.0.0")
- Test scripts:
  - `npm test` - Run Jest tests
  - `npm run test:watch` - Watch mode testing
  - `npm run test:coverage` - Generate coverage reports
- Dev dependency: Jest v29.7.0

### 2. Wrote Comprehensive Test Suite
**File**: [Calc.test.js](Calc.test.js)

Created 10 test cases covering the `Calc.add()` method:

| Test Case | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Should add two positive numbers | Basic functionality: 2 + 3 = 5 |
| Should add two negative numbers | Negative number handling: -2 + -3 = -5 |
| Should add positive and negative | Mixed signs: 10 + (-5) = 5 |
| Should add zero to a number | Zero handling: 5 + 0 = 5 |
| Should add two zeros | Edge case: 0 + 0 = 0 |
| Should add decimal numbers | Floating-point: 1.5 + 2.3 ≈ 3.8 |
| Should add large numbers | Large values: 1,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 |
| Should handle floating point precision | Precision: 0.1 + 0.2 ≈ 0.3 |
| Should verify commutative property | Math property: a+b = b+a |
| Should add with negative zero | Edge case: -0 + 5 = 5 |

**Test Framework**: Jest with `toBeCloseTo()` for floating-point precision

### 3. Configured Jest
**File**: [jest.config.js](jest.config.js)

Jest configuration settings:
- Test environment: Node.js
- Coverage collection from `*.js` files (excluding test files)
- Coverage reporters: text, text-summary, lcov, html
- Test match pattern: `**/*.test.js`
- Verbose output enabled

### 4. Created GitHub Actions Workflow
**File**: [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)

CI/CD pipeline triggers:
- **On Push**: To master, main, or develop branches
- **On Pull Request**: To master, main, or develop branches

Workflow Matrix Testing:
- Node.js versions: 14.x, 16.x, 18.x, 20.x
- Runs on: Ubuntu latest

Workflow Steps:
1. Checkout code
2. Set up Node.js with npm cache
3. Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
4. Run tests (`npm test`)
5. Generate coverage report (`npm run test:coverage`)
6. Upload coverage to Codecov (optional)

### 5. Created .gitignore
**File**: [.gitignore](.gitignore)

Excludes from version control:
- `node_modules/` - Dependency directory
- `coverage/` - Test coverage reports
- `*.log` - Log files
- `.DS_Store` - macOS system files

   ```

### CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- Run on every push to master/main/develop branches
- Run on all pull requests
- Test against 4 Node.js versions simultaneously
- Generate and upload coverage reports
- Provide test results in the GitHub UI

## Test Results Summary

**Total Tests**: 10
**Coverage**: All public methods of Calc class
**Edge Cases Covered**:
- Zero handling

## Conversation Transcript

### Initial Conversation (October 22, 2025)

**User Request**:
```
write tests to calc.js; write github actions to make it ci/cd
```

**Claude Response**:
The assistant analyzed the project and executed the following steps:

1. **Explored the project structure** using Glob and Read tools to understand the existing codebase
   - Found `Calc.js` containing a simple Calculator class with an `add()` static method
   - Identified no existing package.json or test setup

2. **Created package.json** with:
   - Project metadata and test scripts
   - Jest as a dev dependency

3. **Wrote comprehensive test suite** (`Calc.test.js`) with 10 test cases:
   - Basic arithmetic (positive, negative, mixed signs)
   - Edge cases (zeros, decimals, large numbers)
   - Mathematical properties (commutative property)
   - Floating-point precision handling

4. **Configured Jest** (`jest.config.js`):
   - Node.js environment
   - Coverage collection and reporting
   - Test file pattern matching

5. **Created GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
   - Triggers on push and pull requests
   - Matrix testing across Node.js 14.x, 16.x, 18.x, 20.x
   - Automated test execution and coverage reporting
   - Codecov integration

6. **Added supporting files**:
   - `.gitignore` - Excluded node_modules, coverage, logs
   - `jest.config.js` - Detailed Jest configuration

**Result**: A fully functional testing and CI/CD infrastructure was established, ready for use with `npm install` and `npm test`.

### Conversation Update #2 (October 22, 2025)
**User Request**: "use node test instead of jest"

**Context**:
- User selected "describe" keyword from Calc.test.js (line 4)
- Requested migration from Jest to Node.js built-in test runner

**Actions Taken**:
1. Verified Node.js version (18.17.1) - supports built-in test runner
2. **Updated [Calc.test.js](Calc.test.js)**:
   - Replaced Jest imports with Node.js `test` and `assert` modules
   - Changed from `describe`/`test`/`expect` to Node.js native API
   - Used `assert.strictEqual()` for exact equality checks
   - Used `assert.ok()` with `Math.abs()` for floating-point precision checks

3. **Updated [package.json](package.json)**:
   - Removed Jest dependency
   - Changed `test` script from `jest` to `node --test`
   - Changed `test:watch` script to `node --watch --test`
   - Simplified to no devDependencies (Node.js built-in modules)

4. **Updated [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)**:
   - Simplified matrix testing to Node.js 18.x and 20.x (Node 14 and 16 don't support test runner)
   - Removed npm cache configuration (no dependencies to cache)
   - Removed coverage reporting steps (Node test runner TAP format)
   - Removed Codecov integration

5. **Removed jest.config.js** - No longer needed with Node's built-in test runner

**Test Results**:
- ✅ All 10 tests passed
- TAP version 13 output format
- Tests run in ~38ms total
- No external dependencies required

**Benefits of Migration**:
- No external dependencies needed
- Built-in to Node.js 18+ runtime
- Faster test execution
- TAP-compatible output format
- Native ESM and CommonJS support

**Status**: ✅ Successfully migrated to Node.js test runner
